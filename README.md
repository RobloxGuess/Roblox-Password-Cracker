# Roblox-Passhash-Bruteforcer-v1.14_5

This tool depends on Roblox's current authentication methods for connecting players to a specific server. The software captures the handshake between the auth server and the client, then attempts to crack the hash of the handshake. Not all handshakes are able to be cracked, but importing a rainbow table, or using the built in one guarantees 70% or more of your hashes cracked.
Once a hash is cracked, it will output a list of all of the hits in an "output.txt"

Enjoy!
